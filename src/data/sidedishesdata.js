  nutrition:  `Pick your favorite vegetables and we’ll turn them into your own small-batch ferments — naturally, traditionally, and with care. You choose what you love, and we handle the rest: salting, fermenting, and patiently waiting while the good bacteria do their work. The result is a custom jar of crunchy, tangy, probiotic-rich vegetables made just for you, with no additives or preservatives.

Once your batch is ready, we deliver it directly to you so you can enjoy fresh, healthy, gut-friendly goodness at home — as a side dish, snack, or topping for your favorite meals.

Please note:
This service is available by advance reservation only.
Preparation and fermentation time will vary depending on the vegetables you choose.`
